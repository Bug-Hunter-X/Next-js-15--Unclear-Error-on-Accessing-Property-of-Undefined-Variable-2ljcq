# Next.js 15: Unclear Error on Accessing Property of Undefined Variable

This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Next.js 15 related to accessing properties of undefined variables within functional components.  The error message can be misleading, making debugging more challenging than expected.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access a property of a variable that is undefined. This causes an error during rendering.  The error message itself may not immediately point to the root cause.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution by using optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access the property, preventing the error.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.

Navigate to `/about` to see the error (in `about.js`) and then to see the corrected version (in `aboutSolution.js`)
